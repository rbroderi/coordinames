<h2>Shortcut or alias locations</h2>
This is a feature of the map redirect, certain locations on the bitquest map have preselected alias names, such as mot or satoshitown.
If you would like your city or location to be added to this system please send me and <a href="mailto:info@coordinames.com?subject=Alias to Add" target="_top">email</a> with the name and the x and z coordinates.
<h2>Rounding Factor</h2>
Bitquest.coordinames.com uses a rounding factor of 16 or in other words each coordiname is specific to a particular chunk in the Minecraft world.
<h2>I've found a bug what should I do?</h2>

<h2>I've got cool ideas you should add</h2>
Awesome! Just <a href="mailto:info@coordinames.com?subject=Awesome Idea" target="_top">email</a> me and I will do my best to implement them.
<h2>I'm confused what good is this?</h2>
Try it out; it lets you get an easier to remember name for a location on the map.
<h2>Why is the Quantity field optional?</h2>
For most locations this is not needed, it is only used if the x and z coordinates are very large ie > 100000 blocks.
